udm14
=====

Search engine add-on so that the udm=14 parameter is automatically included in Google searches.

As of 22 May 2024, this parameter requests Google to return a more stripped down view for search results, omitting much of the additional junk inserted by allegedly AI processes.

This add-on was created solely to make it easier for me to use this parameter for default search. Uploaded in case it is of use to others.

2025-05-27: Updates from [SyntaxOverflow](https://github.com/SyntaxOverflow) to use manifest v3, remove potential security issue from external favicon.ico, include Google suggestion URL, and prompt for use as default search engine.
